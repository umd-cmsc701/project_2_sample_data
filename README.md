# Test input and output data for Project 2
### test_input
This file contains two bit vectors (ending with **.bin**). Along with it are provides the rank and select queries corresponding to each bit vector. The rank data structure has to be built individually for these files. The *sa_\*.txt* file contains the sample input for constructing the sparse array.

### test_output
It contains the output for testing the rank and select queries and the sparse array. The suffix following *out* should be self explanatory to understand for which input task and file in the **test_input**, the corresponding output file belongs to.
